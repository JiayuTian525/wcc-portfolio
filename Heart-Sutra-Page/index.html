                <h1>Heart Sutra Visulization</h1>
                <p>This project visualizes the classic Buddhist sutra, the Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra, through the chanting of sutra.</p> 
                <p>In the sutra, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva addresses Shaariputra explaining the fundamental emptiness of all phenomena, known through and as the five aggregates of human existence: form, feeling, volitions, perceptions, and consciousness. Avalokiteshvara famously states, "Form is Emptiness. Emptiness is Form”, and declares the other skandhas to be equally empty—that is, dependently originated.</p>
                <p>The images for this work were realized by openframeworks and the Buddha statue was produced by 3D printing. </p>
